However, officials noted that testing in recent days had cleared ground water and rainwater as safe to drink.\nBut fine volcanic ash and emissions continue to pose a public health risk. Exposure could potentially cause breathing difficulties, affect the cardiovascular system, and irritate the lungs, eyes and skin.\nIn an update, the government said 62 people on Mango, one of the worst-hit islands, had to be relocated to the outer island of Nomuka \"after losing their homes and all of their personal belongings\".\nThe government added however, that many of those residents could be moved again to the main island Tongatapu due to a lack of food and supplies.\nIt added that there were under two dozen injuries, mostly from Nomuka .\nRescuers have set up a field hospital there after the existing clinic was swept away in the tsunami.\nShips and planes carrying foreign aid have been arriving in Tonga since last week, after locals were finally able to clear the island's only airport runway of ash.\nNew Zealand and Australia have led the international response, using their air force and naval carriers to make contact-less drops of supplies including water, food, hygiene kits and tents, as well as water-treating and telecommunications repair equipment.\nThe remote archipelago was cut off for five days because the explosions severed the sole fibre-optic sea cable bringing internet to the island.\nA patchy telephone line was restored last week, allowing \"limited international phone calls\".\nBut even communication between Tongatapu, the main island, and the outer islands remains \"an acute challenge\", the Tongan government statement said.\nThey added that a ship was due to arrive this week to repair the internet cable. Firms had previously estimated the cable could take up to four weeks to repair.\nThe arrival of foreign aid has vastly accelerated the flow of information from the stricken island.\nDue to Covid fears, the aid work is still all being carried out by locals through groups like the Red Cross. Tonga, which is effectively Covid-free, has requested no foreign aid workers land in the country to prevent an outbreak.\nBut the UN's representative in the region, Sione Hufanga, told the BBC that could change given the scale of damage."}
